Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in a telecom service using machine learning.
The goal is to identify whether a customer is likely to leave the service based on usage, revenue, and activity patterns.

Dataset Source
The dataset used is a telecom customer churn dataset containing customer usage details such as voice calls, SMS, data usage, recharge behavior, and activity days.
(Target variable: churned — 0 = Not Churned, 1 = Churned)

Steps to Run the Project
Clone the repository or download the project files
Place the dataset file (modeling_data.csv) in the project directory
Open the Jupyter Notebook
Run all cells sequentially from top to bottom
View the final accuracy and confusion matrix output

Model Used
Logistic Regression
Chosen because it is simple, interpretable, and suitable for binary classification problems like churn prediction.

Final Result Summary
The Logistic Regression model successfully predicts customer churn.
Model performance was evaluated using accuracy score and confusion matrix, providing insights into correct and incorrect churn predictions.
